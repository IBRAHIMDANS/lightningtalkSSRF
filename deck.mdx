<Box> 
 Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) / Cross Site Port Attact (XSPA) <p></p> Are Web vulnerabilities for reading files on the local server and also find other active services but this does not end here.
 It is also possible to scan the internal network to map IPs and open ports.

### Impacts of SSRF 
---
 <Appear>
<li> It is possible to scan ports and IP addresses. </li>
<li> Interact with some protocols such as Gopher, which allow you to make further discoveries. </li>
<li> Discover the IP addresses of servers running behind a reverse proxy. </li>
<li> Remote code execution. </li>

How to solve SSRF problem ?
---

It is essential to put in place rules on the resources to be loaded.
You define on 
<ul>
  <Appear>
    <ul>DNS names and / or allowed IP addresses =>
    <li> In the absence of localhost and 0.0.1, this prevents access to server services / files. </li>
    <li> illegitimate access to the internal network will be prevented </li>
     </ul>
    <li>Error-Based : an error, HTTP (404 or 500) for example, to deduce the existing resources or not </li>
    <li>Forbidden acces with Protocols file:// , sftp://  </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>
